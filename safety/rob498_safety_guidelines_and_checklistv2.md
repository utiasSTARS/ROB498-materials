**Micro-UAV Safety Guidelines & Checklists**

**Author: Xuan Wang**

**2023-01-04, v1**

**Disclaimer**: The guidelines and the checklist are for *educational purposes only* in the course ROB498. All the flights should be conducted in room MY580 under the supervision of the professor / TA(s). Individual and/or outdoor flights are NOT ALLOWED; outside flight would very likely lead to violation of the law as defined by [Transport Canada](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety). 

Please read this document carefully\! It is recommended to keep a hard copy of this file on hand while working on/flying your drone. Failure to follow the safety rules/guidelines could cause serious injury to personnel or damage to the Myhal building and equipment.

**Safety Guidelines (while working on your drones):**

1. Charging the battery:   
   Battery type: **LiPo (4S),** Charging Current: **no greater than 2.3 A**.  
   **Different charging settings may reduce battery life or even cause a fire.**  
2. Assembling the drone:  
* Exposed PCBs and solder joints should *not* be in contact with the carbon fibre frame (may be conductive).  
* Always ground/discharge yourself before touching any exposed PCBs.  
* Make sure all the screws are properly tightened as vibration during flight will loosen them.  
* Be very careful with the fragile white JST connectors.  
* Make sure the flight controller (Pixhawk) is tightly attached to the frame, fairly close to CG. If you have to install the Pixhawk in a direction other than the forward-pointing direction, please configure this setting in QGroundControl.  
3. Testing the motors:  
* **Never install propellers before the aircraft is flight-ready\!**   
* Be careful with long hair that can become intertwined with motor shaft.  
4. While other teams/drones are flying:  
* **Never** turn on your transmitter (The Taranis remote control) as this could cause signal interference.

**Pre-Flight Checklist**

Please follow in sequential order. **DO NOT plug in the battery first**.

| Aircraft Check |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| ☐ | Propeller direction check. |
| ☐ | Propellers are installed tightly on the motor shafts. |
| ☐ | The battery is fully charged and tightly strapped down. |
| ☐ | All components are tightly attached to the frame. |
| ☐ | All wires are clear from all propellers and the propellers spin freely. |
| **Aircraft Start-up** |  |
| **Action:** Transmitter Start-up |  |
| ☐ | The *Throttle Stick* is in the down position and all switches are forward. |
| ☐ | *Flight Mode Switch* is in the stabilize position. |
| **Action:** Battery Plug-In |  |
| ☐ | Transmitter signal strength confirm. |
| ☐ | Arm/disarm check. |
| ☐ | Manual fail-safe switch check. |
| **Team & Surrounding Area Check** |  |
| ☐ | Flight area cleared. |
| ☐ | All team members are wearing safety glasses. |
| ☐ | Protection net has been secured. |

**Post-Flight Check**

| ☐ | Keep the transmitter turned on with disarm / fail-safe switch active before unplugging the battery. |
